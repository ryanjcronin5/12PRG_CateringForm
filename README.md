### HCI & User Interface Design Principles
1. Universal Usability

  Allows use for multiple user abilities or formats of use, for example processor power or display quality.
Visibility of system status
The application should tell users what is happening through well timed feedback from the app.
Error prevention
Errors should be limited and not affect the user experience in a negative way, though systems can be inplace to stop errors, logic errors may not be as easy to prevent.
Be consistent
To help the user understand the app consistency is important, formats need to be kept somewhat similar and colour choices should be the same.
Match ideas to real world
The app needs to speak the users with language and terms that they are familiar with, rather than jargon relevant to the app. Follow a realistic format or method.
User has freedom to control
Users may choose functions or actions by mistake and need to find a way out quickly, such as an "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through too many steps.
Use recognition, not recall
Minimise the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.
Flexibility of use
A design should allow multiple ways to complete a task, this means the user can interact with a device according to their abilities or preferences.
Aesthetic design
Dialogues or designs should not contain information which is irrelevant or may not be needed. Every extra piece of information in a design competes with the relevant pieces of information and diminishes their relative visibility.
Help user identity and fix errors
Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
